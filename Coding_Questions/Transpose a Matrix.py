Example1 : Program to transpose a matrix using a nested loop

X = [[12,7],
    [4 ,5],
    [3 ,8]]

result = [[0,0,0],
         [0,0,0]]

# iterate through rows
for i in range(len(X)):
   # iterate through columns
   for j in range(len(X[0])):
       result[j][i] = X[i][j]

for r in result:
   print(r)

==>Output: 
[12, 4, 3]
[7, 5, 8]

Example2: Matrix Transpose using Nested List Comprehension
''' Program to transpose a matrix using list comprehension'''

X = [[12,7],
    [4 ,5],
    [3 ,8]]

result = [[X[j][i] for j in range(len(X))] for i in range(len(X[0]))]

for r in result:
   print(r)

==>Output: 
[12, 4, 3]
[7, 5, 8]
